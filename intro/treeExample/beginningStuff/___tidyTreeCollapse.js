// When we create the svg we use the links to create the line segments between each point
// And we used nodes to create the shapes 

// Nodes reference the descendants, and links reference the links
// You can reference the d3.hierarchy.descendants and skip the layout to parse through it easier, but tinker with it to figure out how it really works
